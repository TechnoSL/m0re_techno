# m0re-techno - legacy edition
This is a version of the hud before i remade it in m0rehud 7, it is kept here for the people who prefer it i guess

[alternative fonts showcase](https://github.com/TechnoSL/m0re_techno/blob/legacy/customizations/Fonts/fonts.md)

This version is entirely based on [dqz's edit](https://github.com/irodionr/dqz_hud/tree/m0re) of [m0rehud](https://github.com/Hypnootize/m0rehud) while retaining mostly the same parts (except mostly menus)
