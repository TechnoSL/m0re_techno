This version is entirely based on [dqz's edit](https://github.com/irodionr/dqz_hud/tree/m0re) of [Hypnootize's m0rehud](https://github.com/Hypnootize/m0rehud) while retaining mostly the same parts

inventory bits, scoreboard, winpanel and some other minor things are taken from FlawHud by CriticalFlaw: https://github.com/CriticalFlaw/flawhud
